This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.1.2.

## Developper Setup

You will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed on your machine.

You can install both tools simultaneously from the [Node.js download page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

You can now install new packages using `npm` command line.

A debugger called: `Launch Chrome against localhost` is set up with **VS Code**, to use it:

1. launch the app with `docker-compose up`.
2. set any breakpoints you need.
3. launch the debugger.
